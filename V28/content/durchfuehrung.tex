First of all the circuit depicted in figure \ref{fig:circuit} needs to be set up.

This circuit consists of a rampg generator and power amplifier which generates a triangular current used for the homogenous magnetic field and the x-axis of the XY-scriptor.
In addition to that there is a high frequency generator connected to a bridge circuit with the sample inside one of its coils.
This high frequency signal is then amplified, filtered and rectified by a superheterodyne receiver, and connected to the y-input of the XY-scriptor.
The frequency $\nu_e$ for the bridge circuit needs to be set.
Since the measured signal is amplified by a superheterodyne receiver with a fixed amplifying frequency of $\nu_\text{ZF}=\SI{552}{\kilo\hertz}$ it needs to be modulated with an oscillator frequency
so that the condition
\begin{equation}
  \nu_\text{OSC}+\nu_\text{ZF}=\nu_e
  \label{eq:freq}
\end{equation}
is met.
With the frequencies set, the bridge circuit needs to be adjusted so that the measured volatages are minimal. This is alternated with increasing the amplification on the superheterodyne receiver.
When the voltage is minimal while apmlification is set to maximum, resonance curves as seen in figure \ref{fig:curve} should appear on the XY-scriptor. If this is not the case, the offset on the
ramp generator needs to be varied until resonance curves appear.

The range of currents generated by the ramp generator is determined with a power meter. It is equal to the length of the curve produced by the scriptor.
By measuring the length at which the resonance spot is seen, the according current can be calculated.
To cancel out errors induced by earth's magnetic field, the resonance curve is measured with the helmholtz coils both parallel and antiparallel to earth's magnetic field.
This measurement is done for four signal frequencies $\nu_e$.
