The calculated g-factor is $\num{2.22(15)}$ and its deviation from the literature value $\num{2.002}$ \cite{gfactor} is $\SI{10.89}{\percent}$.
This deviation is probably mostly due to mode interference voltages which cannot be canceled out completely, especially in the low voltage range of the measurement.
Another source of error is the XY-scriptor, because the position of the resonance point had to be measured by hand with a ruler, making it rather unprecise.
But despite this, the deviation is low enough to validate the literature value and the theory of electron spin resonance with adequate precision.
